# Locating WIC Need and Access in Allegheny County
## Project Description
The food and nutrients we eat during pregnancy and early childhood shape human development and are closely linked to future health and well-being. As a result, food insecurity during this period can have lasting negative consequences for physical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes. Federal nutrition assistance programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), have been shown to improve children’s health and educational outcomes. However, millions of children from low-income families do not receive the life-changing nutrition assistance they are eligible for. In 2021, only 51.2 percent of those eligible for WIC received benefits, equating to about 6 million eligible moms, babies, and young children who did not participate in the program.

Unlike other benefits programs like Medicaid which can fully online applications, WIC applicants must schedule in-person certification appointments at their local WIC clinic. Furthermore, Pennsylvania’s “offline” system still requires benefits to be physically loaded onto cards every three months, meaning those enrolled in the program must visit WIC offices in person, use a drop box, or send their cards through the mail and have them mailed back. 

Allegheny County Executive Sarah Innamorato has highlighted increasing WIC enrollment rates as a key performance indicator for the administration’s human services efforts in its first year. To do so, the County Executive’s Office has stated it will expand on its WIC promotion campaign by sending a mobile van across the County to invite eligible residents to enroll and bringing onsite enrollment to more existing clinics in the coming year, serving parents and young children in more neighborhoods across the County. Therefore, understanding the need at the neighborhood level and how it intersects with the accessibility of WIC offices.

The following analysis first explores trends in WIC participation rates over the past few years to provide a clearer picture of the current trajectory in WIC enrollment here in the County. Then, to support the County Executive’s 1-year plan, we will isolate areas that would most benefit from additional enrollment sites and mobile van visitations.

## Installation
This analysis was conducted in Juypter Notebooks using Python. An updated version of both is required to run this project. All data files are necessary to run the code.  

## How to Use This Project
I hope this project helps County policymakers isolate areas that would most benefit from targeted WIC Enrollment efforts, ensuring efficiency in the process. In the future, I plan to enhance the effect and usefulness of these visualizations by creating an R Shiny Dashboard that allows policymakers to further explore the data according to demographic trends.
